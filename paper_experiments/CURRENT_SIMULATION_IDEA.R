#### CURRENT SIMULATION IDEA ####

# Gaussian distributions in dim 3 and 10 where we increase the rho and see how this works for different approaches
# Linear model + piecewise constant

# Gaussian mixture dist in dim 3 and 10 where we have two mixtures with fixed rho, and increasing the distance between them
# Linear model + piecewise constant

# GenHyp model in dim 3 and 10 where we have fixed all parameters except the beta parameter, giving more and more dkew distribution
# Linear model + piecewise constant


### The piecewise constant model should be created as a sum of different piecewise univariate functions which I am adding.
# 1. A sinus type of function up-down-up-down-up, 2. a step function with steps every unit x. 3. Single step

# Change from using absolute error to absolute error relative to the true value

#### Setting on just Gaussian simulations now, but know how to deal with Gaussian mixtures, so could put on
#### that for dim 3 for both linear and piecewise constant (need to have them dispersing from zero)
